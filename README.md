# Anthony's Dotfiles
This repo contains my personal dotfiles and configurations for my personal systems.
It uses stow to symlink the directory and files to the original location while being
able to manage the dotfiles efficiently. For reference a video [Dotfiles Stow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6XCebnB9gs)

## Mac Version
The main branch contains the dotfiles for my personal MacOS setup and is slightly
different to my linux setup.
